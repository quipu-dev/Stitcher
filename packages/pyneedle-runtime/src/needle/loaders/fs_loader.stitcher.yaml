"FileSystemLoader": |-
  A resource loader that scans the file system for resource files.

  It searches for project roots and then looks for standard resource
  directories (`needle/` and `.stitcher/needle/`).
"FileSystemLoader._load_directory": |-
  Recursively scans a directory and loads all supported files.
"FileSystemLoader._scan_directory": |-
  Scans a directory for supported files.
  Returns a list of layers.
  Note: The order of files within a directory is OS-dependent,
  but we process them deterministically if needed.
"FileSystemLoader._scan_directory_to_dict": |-
  Scans a directory and merges all found files into a single dictionary.
"FileSystemLoader._scan_root": |-
  Scans the single root and returns a merged, flattened dictionary.
"FileSystemLoader.add_root": |-
  Prepends a new search root, giving it highest priority.
"FileSystemLoader.load": |-
  Returns the aggregated view of the domain for this root.
"FileSystemLoader.locate": |-
  For a single-root loader, locate is deterministic.
