detect_circular_dependencies: "Finds all simple cycles in a directed graph.\n\nA simple cycle is a path where the start and end nodes are the same,\nand no other nodes are repeated. Self-loops are not considered simple cycles.\n\nArgs:\n    graph: The directed graph to check.\n\nReturns:\n    A list of cycles, where each cycle is represented as a list of\n    node identifiers (file paths)."
has_path: "Checks if a path exists between two nodes in the graph.\n\nArgs:\n    graph: The directed graph to check.\n    source: The starting node.\n    target: The ending node.\n\nReturns:\n    True if a path exists, False otherwise."
