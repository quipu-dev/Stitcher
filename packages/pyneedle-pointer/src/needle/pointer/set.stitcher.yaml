"PointerSet": |-
  A collection of Semantic Pointers that supports algebraic broadcasting.

  Inherits from built-in set, so standard set operations (union, difference) work as expected.
"PointerSet.__add__": |-
  Operator '+': Broadcasts the add operation to all members.
  Same as __truediv__ but for '+' operator preference.
"PointerSet.__mul__": |-
  Operator '*': Cartesian Product composition.

  {L.a, L.b} * {"1", "2"} -> {L.a.1, L.a.2, L.b.1, L.b.2}
"PointerSet.__truediv__": |-
  Operator '/': Broadcasts the join operation to all members.

  {L.a, L.b} / "end" -> {L.a.end, L.b.end}
