"SymbolRenamerTransformer": |-
  A LibCST transformer that renames symbols at specific locations.
  It does NOT perform semantic analysis; it blindly trusts the provided locations.
"SymbolRenamerTransformer.__init__": |-
  Args:
      rename_map: Mapping from old_name to new_name.
                  Note: For simple Name nodes, this is just the identifier.
      target_locations: List of locations that MUST be renamed.
"SymbolRenamerTransformer._build_location_index": |-
  Builds a lookup index (start_line, start_col) -> UsageLocation for O(1) access.
"SymbolRenamerTransformer._is_target": |-
  Checks if the current node matches a target location.
  Returns the new name if it should be renamed, else None.
