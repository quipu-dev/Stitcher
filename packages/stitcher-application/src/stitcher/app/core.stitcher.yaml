"StitcherApp": |-
  The central orchestrator for all Stitcher operations.

  This class coordinates the scanner, document manager, signature manager, and
  stub generator to execute high-level commands like check, generate, and pump.
"StitcherApp.doc_manager": |-
  Service for managing documentation assets.
"StitcherApp.run_check": |-
  Verify the structural and content consistency between source code and external YAML documentation.

  Args:
    force_relink: If True, automatically update the signature baseline for functions that have changed.
    reconcile: If True, automatically accept both signature and doc changes.
"StitcherApp.run_from_config": |-
  Execute the main stub generation workflow based on the configuration found in pyproject.toml.

  This includes scanning source files, processing plugins, and generating .pyi files.
"StitcherApp.run_init": |-
  Alias for 'pump --reconcile'.
  Initializes the project by syncing source docs to YAML, respecting existing YAML content.
"StitcherApp.run_inject": |-
  Inject documentation from .stitcher.yaml files back into the source code as docstrings.

  This operation modifies source files in-place and is intended for "injecting" from
  the Stitcher workflow back to standard Python development.
"StitcherApp.run_pump": |-
  Extract new or modified docstrings from source code and update the .stitcher.yaml files.

  Args:
    strip: If True, remove the extracted docstrings from the source code immediately.
    force: If True, overwrite existing YAML content with source content in case of conflict.
    reconcile: If True, prefer existing YAML content and ignore source content in case of conflict.
  Returns:
    A PumpResult object indicating success and listing files with now-redundant docstrings.
"StitcherApp.run_strip": |-
  Remove all docstrings from the source code files defined in the configuration or a specific list of files.

  This is a destructive operation used to enforce a "pure code" style where docs live strictly in YAML.

  Args:
    files: An optional list of specific files to strip. If None, uses config.
