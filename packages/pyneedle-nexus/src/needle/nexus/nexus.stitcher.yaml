"OverlayNexus": |-
  Standard implementation of the Nexus protocol using a logical overlay strategy.

  It manages an ordered list of resource loaders and uses `collections.ChainMap`
  to create prioritized, logical views of resources without performing
  a physical merge.
"OverlayNexus.__init__": |-
  Initializes the Nexus with a list of loaders.

  Args:
      loaders: A list of resource loaders. The order determines priority;
               loaders at the beginning of the list override those at the end.
      default_lang: The fallback language to use if the target language is not found.
"OverlayNexus._get_or_create_view": |-
  Lazily loads and caches the ChainMap view for a given language.
"OverlayNexus._resolve_lang": |-
  Determines the current language based on a standard hierarchy.
"OverlayNexus.get": |-
  Resolves a semantic pointer to a string value with graceful fallback.
"OverlayNexus.reload": |-
  Clears internal caches to force a reload on the next `get` call.
