"SpyBus": |-
  A Test Utility that spies on the global stitcher.common.bus singleton.

  Instead of replacing the bus instance (which fails if modules have already
  imported the instance via 'from stitcher.common import bus'),
  this utility patches the instance methods directly.
"SpyBus.assert_id_called": |-
  Asserts that a message with the given ID was sent.
"SpyBus.get_messages": |-
  Returns all messages captured by the spy.
"SpyBus.patch": |-
  Patches the global bus to capture messages.

  Args:
      monkeypatch: The pytest monkeypatch fixture.
      target: Kept for compatibility with existing tests, but functionally
              we always patch the singleton instance found at stitcher.common.bus.
"SpyRenderer": |-
  A renderer that captures structured message data.
"SpyRenderer.messages": |-
  A list of captured messages.
"SpyRenderer.record": |-
  Records a semantic message call.
"SpyRenderer.render": |-
  Mock render implementation.
