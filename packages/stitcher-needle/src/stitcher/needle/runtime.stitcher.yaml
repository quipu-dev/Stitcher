"Needle": |-
  The runtime kernel for semantic addressing.
"Needle._find_project_root": |-
  Finds the project root by searching upwards for common markers.
  Search priority: pyproject.toml -> .git
"Needle._resolve_lang": |-
  Determines the current language based on hierarchy:
  1. Explicitly passed 'lang' argument.
  2. STITCHER_LANG environment variable.
  3. System LANG environment variable (e.g., zh_CN.UTF-8 -> zh).
  4. Default (en).
"Needle.add_root": |-
  Adds a new search root to the beginning of the list.
"Needle.get": |-
  Resolves a semantic pointer to a string value with graceful fallback.

  Lookup Order:
  1. Target Language (resolved via _resolve_lang)
  2. Default Language (en)
  3. Identity (the key itself)
