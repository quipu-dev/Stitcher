"OverlayNexus": |-
  [Composition Layer]
  Implements vertical fallback by iterating through a stack of loaders.
  Inherits policy logic (get) from BaseLoader.
"OverlayNexus.__init__": |-
  Initializes the Nexus with a list of loaders.

  Args:
      loaders: A list of resource loaders. The order determines priority;
               loaders at the beginning of the list override those at the end.
      default_domain: The fallback domain to use if the target domain is not found.
"OverlayNexus._get_or_create_view": |-
  Lazily loads and caches the ChainMap view for a given domain.
"OverlayNexus._resolve_domain": |-
  Determines the current active domain based on environment variables and system settings.
"OverlayNexus.fetch": |-
  [Composition Layer Implementation]
  Vertical Fallback: Ask each loader in order. First one to return non-None wins.
"OverlayNexus.get": |-
  Resolves a semantic pointer to a string value with graceful fallback.
"OverlayNexus.load": |-
  Returns the overlay view for the requested domain. This enables a Nexus
  to act as a data source for another Nexus.
"OverlayNexus.locate": |-
  Finds the physical path for a resource by delegating to the first writable loader.
"OverlayNexus.put": |-
  Writes a value to a resource by delegating to the first writable loader.
"OverlayNexus.reload": |-
  Clears internal caches for one or all domains.
