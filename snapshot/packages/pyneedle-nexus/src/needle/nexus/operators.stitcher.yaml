"OverlayOperator": |-
  A pure functional operator used to compose multiple operators vertically.
  
  Unlike `OverlayNexus`, it has no concept of 'domain', 'fallback', or 'cache'.
  It simply tries each operator in the list until one returns a value.
"OverlayOperator.__call__": |-
  Iterates through child operators and returns the first non-None result.
"OverlayOperator.__init__": |-
  Initializes with a prioritized list of operators (first has highest priority).
