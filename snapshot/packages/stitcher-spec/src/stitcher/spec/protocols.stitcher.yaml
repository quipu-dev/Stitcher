"FingerprintStrategyProtocol": |-
  Defines the strategy for computing composite fingerprints for code entities.

  This protocol encourages a 'Composition over Inheritance' approach.
  Implementations should act as coordinators that delegate to multiple
  specific hashers (e.g., StructureHasher, ASTHasher) and merge their results.
"FingerprintStrategyProtocol.compute": |-
  Compute a composite Fingerprint containing various stability hashes and
  representations for the given entity.

  The returned Fingerprint object acts as a container for all calculated
  metrics (e.g., 'current_code_structure_hash', 'current_code_ast_hash').
"LanguageParserProtocol": |-
  Defines the contract for parsing source code into Stitcher's IR (ModuleDef).
"LanguageParserProtocol.parse": |-
  Parse the given source code string into a ModuleDef intermediate representation.

  Args:
      source_code: The raw source code of the file.
      file_path: Optional relative path for error reporting and metadata.
"LanguageTransformerProtocol": |-
  Defines the contract for performing lossless code transformations (Strip/Inject).
"LanguageTransformerProtocol.inject": |-
  Inject docstrings into the source code based on a mapping of FQNs to doc content.

  Args:
      source_code: The original source code.
      docs: A dictionary mapping Fully Qualified Names (e.g. "MyClass.method")
            to the desired docstring content.
"LanguageTransformerProtocol.strip": |-
  Remove all docstrings from the source code while preserving layout/comments.
"StubGeneratorProtocol": |-
  Defines the contract for generating type stub files from Stitcher's IR.
"StubGeneratorProtocol.generate": |-
  Generate the content of a type stub file (e.g. .pyi) from the ModuleDef IR.
LockManagerProtocol: "Protocol for managing the stitcher.lock file, which serves as the distributed\npersistence layer for fingerprints."
URIGeneratorProtocol: "Protocol for generating Stitcher Uniform Resource Identifiers (SURIs).\nSURIs must be anchored to the workspace root to ensure global uniqueness."
