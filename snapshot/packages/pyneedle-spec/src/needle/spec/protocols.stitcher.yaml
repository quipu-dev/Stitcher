"OperatorProtocol": |-
  The unified interface for all operators in the functional kernel.
  
  Unlike Loaders which mix configuration, policy, and fetching, 
  Operators follow the "Builder is the Product" philosophy:
  - __init__: Handles configuration (context injection).
  - __call__: Handles execution (stateless transformation).
"OperatorProtocol.__call__": |-
  Executes the operator's logic.
  
  For Config Operators: key=str, returns Any.
  For Factory Operators: key=SemanticPointer, returns Operator.
  For Executor Operators: key=SemanticPointer, returns str or None.
"PointerSetProtocol": |-
  Defines the contract for a set of Semantic Pointers (Ls).

  It represents a 'Semantic Domain' or 'Surface' rather than a single point.
"PointerSetProtocol.__add__": |-
  Operator '+': Broadcasts the add operation to all members.
"PointerSetProtocol.__iter__": |-
  Iterating over the set yields individual SemanticPointers.
"PointerSetProtocol.__mul__": |-
  Operator '*': Broadcasts a cartesian product operation.
"PointerSetProtocol.__or__": |-
  Operator '|': Unions two PointerSets.
"PointerSetProtocol.__truediv__": |-
  Operator '/': Broadcasts the join operation to all members of the set.
  Example: {L.a, L.b} / "end" -> {L.a.end, L.b.end}
"SemanticPointerProtocol": |-
  Defines the contract for a Semantic Pointer (L).

  A Semantic Pointer is a recursive, immutable reference to a semantic location.
  It serves as the primary key for addressing resources in the Nexus.
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__add__": |-
  Operator '+': Joins the pointer with a string or another pointer.
  Example: L.auth + "login" -> L.auth.login
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__eq__": |-
  Pointers must be comparable with strings and other pointers.
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__getattr__": |-
  Creates a new pointer extended by the attribute name.
  Example: L.auth -> "auth"
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__hash__": |-
  Pointers must be hashable to be used as dictionary keys.
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__mul__": |-
  Operator '*': Distributes the pointer over a set of suffixes, creating a PointerSet.
  Example: L.auth * {"read", "write"} -> {L.auth.read, L.auth.write}
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__str__": |-
  Returns the fully qualified string representation of the pointer.
  Example: "auth.login.success"
"SemanticPointerProtocol.__truediv__": |-
  Operator '/': Joins the pointer with a string or another pointer (path-like syntax).
  Example: L.auth / "login" -> L.auth.login
"T_Pointer": |-
  A TypeVar used for covariant type hinting in the SemanticPointerProtocol.
