FileCheckResult: |-
  Data container representing the outcome of a consistency check for a single file.
FileCheckResult.error_count: |-
  Total number of critical issues (errors) discovered in the file.
FileCheckResult.errors: |-
  A collection of errors keyed by their category (e.g., 'conflict', 'mismatch').
FileCheckResult.is_clean: |-
  Returns True if the file has no issues and no reconciliation was performed.
FileCheckResult.path: |-
  The relative path to the source file that was inspected.
FileCheckResult.reconciled: |-
  The count of signature mismatches that were automatically updated during the check.
FileCheckResult.warning_count: |-
  Total number of non-blocking issues (warnings) discovered in the file.
FileCheckResult.warnings: |-
  A collection of warnings keyed by their category (e.g., 'missing', 'untracked').
StitcherApp: |-
  The central orchestrator for all Stitcher operations.

  This class coordinates the scanner, document manager, signature manager, and
  stub generator to execute high-level commands like check, generate, and hydrate.
StitcherApp.run_check: |-
  Verify the structural and content consistency between source code and external YAML documentation.

  Args:
    update_signatures: If True, automatically update the signature baseline for functions that have changed.
StitcherApp.run_eject: |-
  Inject documentation from .stitcher.yaml files back into the source code as docstrings.

  This operation modifies source files in-place and is intended for "ejecting" from
  the Stitcher workflow back to standard Python development.
StitcherApp.run_from_config: |-
  Execute the main stub generation workflow based on the configuration found in pyproject.toml.

  This includes scanning source files, processing plugins, and generating .pyi files.
StitcherApp.run_hydrate: |-
  Extract new or modified docstrings from source code and update the .stitcher.yaml files.

  Args:
    strip: If True, remove the extracted docstrings from the source code immediately.
    force: If True, overwrite existing YAML content with source content in case of conflict.
    reconcile: If True, prefer existing YAML content and ignore source content in case of conflict.
StitcherApp.run_init: |-
  Initialize Stitcher for a project by creating the first batch of .stitcher.yaml files.

  This command scans the codebase and extracts existing docstrings to seed the documentation store.
StitcherApp.run_strip: |-
  Remove all docstrings from the source code files defined in the configuration.

  This is a destructive operation used to enforce a "pure code" style where docs live strictly in YAML.
