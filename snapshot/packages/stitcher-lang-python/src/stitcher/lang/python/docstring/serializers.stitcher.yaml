"BaseSerializer": |-
  Base serializer that handles Addon preservation and common utilities.
"BaseSerializer._decode_item_value": |-
  Decodes string value into parts.
  Since we don't encode types, this just treats the whole string as description.
"BaseSerializer._encode_item_value": |-
  Encodes DocstringItem into a string.
  We deliberately DO NOT encode the type annotation here to avoid Single Source of Truth violation.
  Types should be derived from the code signature, not stored in YAML.
"RawSerializer": |-
  Legacy serializer.
  Format:
      "summary string"
  OR
      {"Raw": "summary string", "Addon...": ...}
"StructuredSerializer": |-
  Base class for Google/NumPy serializers.
