"AssetPathResolver": |-
  Centralized resolver for Stitcher asset paths (Sidecars and Signatures).

  This class encapsulates the logic for mapping a source code file to its
  corresponding documentation sidecar (.stitcher.yaml) and signature file (.json).
"AssetPathResolver.get_doc_path": |-
  Returns the path to the documentation sidecar (.stitcher.yaml).
  The doc sidecar sits right next to the source file.
"AssetPathResolver.get_signature_path": |-
  Returns the path to the signature sidecar (.json).
  The signature sidecar sits in .stitcher/signatures/, mirroring the source tree.
