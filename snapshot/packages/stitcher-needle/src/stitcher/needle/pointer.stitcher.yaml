"SemanticPointer": |-
  A recursive proxy object that represents a semantic path in the Stitcher universe.

  It allows developers to use dot notation (e.g., L.auth.login.success) to refer
  to semantic keys, which are converted to their string representation
  (e.g., "auth.login.success") at runtime.

  This class is designed to be:
  1. Zero-dependency: It relies only on Python standard features.
  2. Lightweight: It performs no I/O or complex logic.
  3. Immutable-ish: Attribute access returns a *new* instance.
"SemanticPointer.__eq__": |-
  Allows comparison with strings or other pointers.
  L.a.b == "a.b" is True.
"SemanticPointer.__getattr__": |-
  Returns a new SemanticPointer with the appended path component.
"SemanticPointer.__str__": |-
  Returns the full dot-separated path string.
